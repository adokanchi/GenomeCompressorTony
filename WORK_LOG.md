| The whole weekend and previous week |             |                                                                                            Issues with computer stopped me from testing any code I wrote. I spent 10 minutes writing something that I thought would work and was unable to test. |

| Nov 18                              | 1:10-1:40pm | I recoded my initial attempt, changing the data types from booleans to bits/ints, and fixing the issue where each set of bits was cast to a 32-bit integer before being passed in. The code seems to work now. Still needs to be tested further. |
